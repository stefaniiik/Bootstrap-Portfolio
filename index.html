                        <p> I am originally from Chicago, IL and I attended university at Northern Illinois in DeKalb. I have
                            a twin sister, who's name is Amanda and she lives in Northern Phoenix. I also have an older brother
                            who currently resides in Central Lake, MI. I have lived in Tempe coming up on a year in May;
                            however, I have been visiting Arizona for the last twenty or so years. I will be turning 27 at
                            the end of May.</p>
                        <p>I currently work for an auto warranty company in the accounts payable department, and while I enjoy
                            the people I work with, I am looking for a career change. I have my BA in English and a minor
                            in Communications. I have decided to puruse this coding certificate because I believe it will
                            provide me with enough challenges to keep me interested in the work I am doing. I also believe
                            it will provide a certain type of gratification because I will be creating things, and working
                            towards something with a purpose.</p>
